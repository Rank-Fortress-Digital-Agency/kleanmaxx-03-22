                    Air ducts in Houston may not seem like a big deal. But it’s important to maintain them for your family’s health. Dirty air ducts can have serious consequences on the respiratory system, including asthma and lung cancer.  It is also necessary to clean out the dryer vents regularly because lint from clothes can ignite, causing a fire.

                    If you’re interested in getting your air ducts cleaned, there are a few things that you need to know. First of all, not every contractor offers this service.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, not every home needs its air ducts cleaned. If your ducts are in good condition and aren’t full of dust and dirt, then they probably don’t need to be cleaned. However, if you have any concerns about the condition of your ductwork, or if they haven’t been cleaned in a while, then it’s best to contact a professional for advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, be sure to ask the contractor questions before hiring them. Find out what type of equipment they will use and what type of air duct cleaning process they will use. Make sure that you’re comfortable with the contractor and their methods before hiring them to clean your air ducts.
